Copy the "Client ID" and "Client secret" and keep them safe.

Next, head back to Deskpro and enter the Client ID and Secret into the app settings form.

To configure who can see and use the Sage app, head to the "Permissions" tab and select those users and/or groups you'd like to have access.

When you're happy, click "Install".
